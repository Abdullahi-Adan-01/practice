                <strong>How to Start your own Self Development Journey</strong>
            </div>
            <p>You can start your personal development skills by <br> <br> taking classes, learning from the people
                around
                you,
                gaining new talents and improving upon existing ones. <br> <br> Follow these guidelines to develop
                yourself
                personally:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="span-3">Overcome your fears.</span> <br><br> Fear can prevent you from growing and
                    progressing.
                    If you are afraid of public
                    speaking, for instance, take a class or join a group that helps people become better
                    public
                    speakers.If you are afraid of taking risks, find a mentor who can help you make good
                    decisions and
                    build your confidence.Grow and learn by trying things you might not be comfortable doing.
                    If you
                    are shy, try starting a conversation or introducing yourself to new people at a reception or
                    workshop.
                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><span class="span-4">Read.</span> <br><br> Reading can expand your knowledge and vocabulary and keep
                    you
                    informed. It can also stimulate
                    your mind and can improve your critical thinking skills. Try setting a goal to read at least one
                    educational or motivational article a day, or one book a month.</li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li><span class="span-5">Learn something new.</span> <br><br> Learn a new skill or topic, whether you do
                    it yourself or sign up for a class. You might, for instance, take courses to learn another language,
                    a new software program or how to write code. Consider enrolling in a coding class or watching a
                    video on how to speak Spanish.
